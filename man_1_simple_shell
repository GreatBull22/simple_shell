Description in.SH
The interactive user interface with an operating system is referred to as a shell in UNIX.

Typically, a shell denotes a user interface with a command syntax 

.B Summary

The simple shell is a command that translates lines from files or the terminal and typically runs other commands after reading them. It is the application that launches as soon as a user logs in. The interpretative language is advantageously shared by both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts), and it has several features to support interactive use. In other words, commands can be entered directly into a simple shell that is already running or they can be stored in a file that the simple shell will then execute.
